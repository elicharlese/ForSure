# Backend Development Checklist

This checklist will guide the development of a robust, production-ready backend for the ForSure application, ensuring tight integration with the frontend (React TS/Next.js), blockchain (Solana via Rust SDK), Supabase, and Vercel deployment. Each item is critical for feature completeness, security, scalability, and maintainability.

---

## 1. **Project Setup & Environment**
- [ ] Initialize a dedicated backend directory (e.g., `/api` or `/backend`).
- [ ] Set up TypeScript for all Node.js backend code.
- [ ] Configure environment variables for all secrets (JWT, DB, Supabase, Solana, etc.).
- [ ] Add `.env.example` and document all required variables.
- [ ] Set up linting, formatting, and pre-commit hooks.
- [ ] Ensure all backend code is covered by tests (unit/integration).

## 2. **API & Routing**
- [ ] Use Next.js API routes for serverless endpoints (REST/GraphQL as needed).
- [ ] Implement versioning for APIs (e.g., `/api/v1/`).
- [ ] Validate all incoming requests (Zod or similar schema validation).
- [ ] Rate limit sensitive endpoints.

## 3. **Authentication & Authorization**
- [ ] Integrate Supabase Auth for user management (registration, login, password reset).
- [ ] Support JWT-based authentication for API endpoints.
- [ ] Implement role-based access control (user/admin, etc.).
- [ ] Secure all protected routes (frontend and backend).
- [ ] Add social login (Google, GitHub, etc.) via Supabase if required.

## 4. **Database & Data Models**
- [ ] Use Supabase (Postgres) for primary data storage.
- [ ] Define and migrate all tables: Users, Projects, Teams, Blog, etc.
- [ ] Set up Prisma or Drizzle ORM for type-safe DB access (if not using Supabase client directly).
- [ ] Implement all CRUD operations for each model.
- [ ] Add database indexes for performance-critical queries.
- [ ] Write seed scripts for development/testing.

## 5. **Blockchain Integration (Solana)**
- [ ] Set up Rust-based Solana SDK microservice (separate repo or `/blockchain` dir).
- [ ] Define clear API (REST/gRPC/WebSocket) for frontend/backend to interact with Solana service.
- [ ] Implement wallet creation, transaction signing, and on-chain data storage as required.
- [ ] Secure all blockchain endpoints (auth, rate limiting).
- [ ] Write integration tests for blockchain flows.
- [ ] Document all blockchain endpoints and usage.

## 6. **Business Logic & Features**
- [ ] Implement all backend logic for:
    - Project management (CRUD, collaboration, status updates)
    - User profiles (CRUD, avatar upload, role management)
    - Blog system (CRUD, comments, likes)
    - AI features (chat, search, etc. â€” connect to AI providers as needed)
    - Career/job listings (CRUD, application submission)
    - Documentation (serve docs, feedback, interactive demos)
    - File uploads (secure, validate, store in Supabase Storage or S3)
- [ ] Ensure all logic is covered by tests.

## 7. **Real-time & Webhooks**
- [ ] Use Supabase real-time features for live updates (chat, notifications, etc.).
- [ ] Implement webhooks for external integrations (e.g., Vercel deploy hooks, payment providers).

## 8. **Security**
- [ ] Sanitize and validate all user input.
- [ ] Use HTTPS everywhere (enforced in production).
- [ ] Store secrets securely (never commit to git).
- [ ] Implement CORS policies.
- [ ] Add logging and monitoring (Sentry, LogRocket, etc.).
- [ ] Regularly audit dependencies for vulnerabilities.

## 9. **Testing & Quality Assurance**
- [ ] Write unit, integration, and end-to-end tests for all backend logic.
- [ ] Set up CI/CD for automated testing and deployment.
- [ ] Use test coverage tools and aim for >90% coverage.

## 10. **Deployment & Production Readiness**
- [ ] Configure Vercel for backend deployment (API routes, serverless functions).
- [ ] Set up staging and production environments.
- [ ] Ensure all environment variables are set in Vercel dashboard.
- [ ] Enable monitoring and error reporting in production.
- [ ] Push all code to GitHub (main branch is always deployable).
- [ ] Tag and document production releases.

## 11. **Documentation**
- [ ] Document all API endpoints (OpenAPI/Swagger or Markdown).
- [ ] Write onboarding docs for backend developers.
- [ ] Document blockchain integration and usage.
- [ ] Update README with backend-specific instructions.

**Tip:** Review this checklist before each release. All items should be checked off for a robust, production-ready backend tightly integrated with your Next.js/React TS frontend, Supabase, and Solana blockchain features.
