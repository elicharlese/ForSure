# Backend Development Checklist

This checklist will guide the development of a robust, production-ready backend for the ForSure application, ensuring tight integration with the frontend (React TS/Next.js), blockchain (Solana via Rust SDK), Supabase, and Vercel deployment. Each item is critical for feature completeness, security, scalability, and maintainability.

**Current Status: ‚úÖ Backend implementation significantly advanced - Core infrastructure complete**

---

## 1. **Project Setup & Environment**
- [x] Initialize Next.js API routes directory (`/app/api/`).
- [x] Set up TypeScript for all Node.js backend code.
- [x] Install required dependencies (Zod, Supabase, JWT, etc.).
- [ ] Configure environment variables for all secrets (JWT, DB, Supabase, Solana, etc.).
- [ ] Add `.env.example` and document all required variables.
- [ ] Set up linting, formatting, and pre-commit hooks.
- [ ] Ensure all backend code is covered by tests (unit/integration).

## 2. **API & Routing**
- [x] Create Next.js API routes for serverless endpoints (REST/GraphQL as needed).
- [ ] Implement versioning for APIs (e.g., `/api/v1/`).
- [x] Validate all incoming requests (Zod or similar schema validation).
- [x] Rate limit sensitive endpoints.

## 3. **Authentication & Authorization** 
- [x] Replace mock auth context with Supabase Auth integration.
- [x] Integrate Supabase Auth for user management (registration, login, password reset).
- [x] Support JWT-based authentication for API endpoints.
- [ ] Implement role-based access control (user/admin, etc.).
- [ ] Secure all protected routes (frontend and backend).
- [ ] Add social login (Google, GitHub, etc.) via Supabase if required.

## 4. **Database & Data Models**
- [x] Install and configure Supabase client for TypeScript.
- [ ] Use Supabase (Postgres) for primary data storage.
- [x] Define and migrate all tables: Users, Projects, Teams, Blog, etc.
- [ ] Set up Prisma or Drizzle ORM for type-safe DB access (if not using Supabase client directly).
- [x] Implement all CRUD operations for each model.
- [x] Add database indexes for performance-critical queries.
- [ ] Write seed scripts for development/testing.

## 5. **Blockchain Integration (Solana)**
- [ ] Set up Rust-based Solana SDK microservice (separate repo or `/blockchain` dir).
- [ ] Define clear API (REST/gRPC/WebSocket) for frontend/backend to interact with Solana service.
- [ ] Implement wallet creation, transaction signing, and on-chain data storage as required.
- [ ] Secure all blockchain endpoints (auth, rate limiting).
- [ ] Write integration tests for blockchain flows.
- [ ] Document all blockchain endpoints and usage.

## 6. **Business Logic & Features**
- [x] Create API endpoints for all current frontend pages:
    - [x] Project management (CRUD, collaboration, status updates) - `/api/projects/*`
    - [x] User profiles (CRUD, avatar upload, role management) - `/api/users/*`
    - [x] Blog system (CRUD, comments, likes) - `/api/blog/*`
    - [x] AI features (chat, search, etc.) - `/api/ai/*`
    - [x] Career/job listings (CRUD, application submission) - `/api/careers/*`
    - [x] Documentation (serve docs, feedback, interactive demos) - `/api/docs/*`
    - [x] Templates system - `/api/templates/*`
    - [x] File uploads (secure, validate, store in Supabase Storage) - `/api/upload/*`
- [ ] Ensure all logic is covered by tests.

## 7. **Real-time & Webhooks**
- [ ] Use Supabase real-time features for live updates (chat, notifications, etc.).
- [ ] Implement webhooks for external integrations (e.g., Vercel deploy hooks, payment providers).

## 8. **Security**
- [x] Sanitize and validate all user input.
- [ ] Use HTTPS everywhere (enforced in production).
- [x] Store secrets securely (never commit to git).
- [ ] Implement CORS policies.
- [ ] Add logging and monitoring (Sentry, LogRocket, etc.).
- [ ] Regularly audit dependencies for vulnerabilities.

## 9. **Testing & Quality Assurance**
- [ ] Write unit, integration, and end-to-end tests for all backend logic.
- [ ] Set up CI/CD for automated testing and deployment.
- [ ] Use test coverage tools and aim for >90% coverage.

## 10. **Deployment & Production Readiness**
- [x] Install Supabase and other required dependencies to package.json.
- [ ] Configure Vercel for backend deployment (API routes, serverless functions).
- [ ] Set up staging and production environments.
- [ ] Ensure all environment variables are set in Vercel dashboard.
- [ ] Enable monitoring and error reporting in production.
- [x] Push all code to GitHub (main branch is always deployable).
- [ ] Tag and document production releases.

## 11. **Documentation**
- [x] Document all API endpoints (OpenAPI/Swagger or Markdown).
- [ ] Write onboarding docs for backend developers.
- [ ] Document blockchain integration and usage.
- [x] Update README with backend-specific instructions.

## 12. **Priority Implementation Order**
1. **Phase 1: Foundation** 
   - [x] Set up Supabase project and environment variables
   - [x] Create basic API structure (`/app/api/auth/`, `/app/api/users/`)
   - [x] Replace mock auth with real Supabase auth

2. **Phase 2: Core Features**
   - [x] Implement user management and profiles
   - [x] Create project management APIs
   - [x] Add file upload functionality

3. **Phase 3: Advanced Features**
   - [x] Implement blog system
   - [x] Add AI features integration
   - [x] Create template management system

4. **Phase 4: Blockchain & Production**
   - [ ] Integrate Solana blockchain features
   - [ ] Add comprehensive testing
   - [ ] Deploy to production with monitoring

**Status Summary:** 
- ‚úÖ Frontend architecture complete with comprehensive UI components
- ‚úÖ Backend implementation significantly advanced - Core API infrastructure complete
- ‚úÖ Supabase integration implemented with authentication and database schema
- ‚ö†Ô∏è  Production deployment pending environment configuration and blockchain integration
- üîÑ Testing framework and blockchain integration remain pending

**Next Steps:** Begin with Phase 1 implementation - Set up Supabase and create basic API structure.

**Tip:** Review this checklist before each release. All items should be checked off for a robust, production-ready backend tightly integrated with your Next.js/React TS frontend, Supabase, and Solana blockchain features.
