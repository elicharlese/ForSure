# ForSure Language (FSH) üöÄ
ForSure is a language designed to simplify projects by using a flat-file-like structured language/compiler/cli/converter system. It allows you to describe and document file structures in a clear and concise manner, similar to how you would write a Dockerfile for a container. ForSure uses a simple, human-readable syntax to represent directories, files, and their relationships.

## Getting Started üéâ
To start using ForSure, clone this repository and review the sample `.fs` files included. You can write your ForSure definitions using any text editor.

## Features ‚ú®
- **Hierarchical Structure:** Mimics the natural file system's hierarchy.
- **Comments and Annotations:** Offers inline commenting and metadata association.
- **@import Directives:** Facilitates file inclusion for reusable structures.
- **Custom Attributes:** Extends elements with user-defined attributes like permissions and sizes.
- **Readable and Simple:** A clean syntax prioritizing user understanding and ease of use.

## Writing Your First ForSure File ‚úèÔ∏è

### Basic Example

Here's a basic example of what a `.fs` file looks like:

```forsure
root:
  # Main source code directory
  - src:
      - main.js { entry: true }
      - utils:
          # Utility scripts
          - helpers.js
          - date.js { timezone: "UTC" }
  # Assets for front-end design
  - assets:
      - logo.svg
      - css:
          # Style sheets
          - theme.css
  # Documentation file
  - README.md
```

### Intermediate Example

An intermediate example including custom attributes and import directives:

```
root:
  - src:
      @import 'common-files.fs'
      - app.js { entry: true, permissions: "644" }
      - config.json { env: "production" }
  - tests:
      - test_app.js
  - docs:
      - api.md
      - readme.md
```

### Advanced Example

An advanced example showcasing nested imports and complex attributes:

```
root:
  - server:
      @import 'server-config.fs'
      - index.js { entry: true, permissions: "755" }
      - lib:
          - database.js { connection: "secure" }
          - cache.js { strategy: "LRU" }
  - client:
      @import 'client-components.fs'
      - index.html
      - js:
          - app.js { async: true }
  - build:
      - Dockerfile
      - Jenkinsfile
```
