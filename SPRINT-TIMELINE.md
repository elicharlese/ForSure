# Sprint Timeline for Building "ForSure" Programming Language

## Pre-planning Phase

- **Week 1: Research and Conceptualization**
  - Identify core features and design goals for ForSure.
  - Study various programming language paradigms for inspiration.

### Sprint 1: Environment Setup & Basic Structure

- **Week 2: Development Environment Setup**
  - Set up code repositories, build systems, and continuous integration services.
  - Establish coding standards and documentation guidelines.

- **Week 3-4: Language Specification**
  - Draft the initial version of the language syntax and semantics.
  - Define basic data types and operations.

### Sprint 2: Core Language Development

- **Week 5-6: Parser and Lexer Implementation**
  - Develop the lexer to tokenize input source.
  - Create a parser that builds an abstract syntax tree (AST).

- **Week 7-8: Interpreter Creation**
  - Implement an interpreter to execute AST directly.
  - Test with simple scripts to ensure language constructs work as intended.

### Sprint 3: Advanced Features Implementation

- **Week 9-10: Standard Library Development**
  - Start building a standard library with common functions and utilities.
  - Integrate the standard library into the language core.

- **Week 11-12: Error Handling and Debugging Support**
  - Design error handling mechanisms.
  - Provide debugging tools to trace and fix issues within ForSure programs.

### Sprint 4: Optimization and Testing

- **Week 13-14: Performance Optimization**
  - Optimize the interpreter for speed and memory usage.
  - Profile sample programs to identify performance bottlenecks.

- **Week 15-16: Comprehensive Testing**
  - Write extensive test cases covering all aspects of the language.
  - Conduct stress tests and fix any identified bugs.

### Sprint 5: Documentation and Tooling

- **Week 17-18: Documentation**
  - Draft official language documentation including setup, syntax guide, and standard library reference.
  - Create tutorials and example projects for new users.

- **Week 19-20: Developer Tools**
  - Build or integrate developer tools such as a REPL, package manager, and linters.
  - Ensure tooling is documented and aligns with user expectations.

### Sprint 6: Release Preparation

- **Week 21-22: Beta Release**
  - Release a beta version to gather user feedback.
  - Monitor use cases and iterate based on feedback.

- **Week 23-24: Final Touches and Launch**
  - Address any issues from the beta release.
  - Prepare launch materials and plan the announcement.

### Post-Launch

- **Ongoing: Maintenance and Improvement**
  - Establish processes for bug tracking and feature requests.
  - Schedule regular updates and engage with the developer community.

**Note:** The actual sprint timeline may vary based on the complexity of features, team size, and other project-specific factors. This is a high-level guide that should be adapted to fit the particular needs of your development process and the "ForSure" programming language.
