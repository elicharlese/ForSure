# Deployment Checklist

## Pre-Deployment Checklist

### ‚úÖ Code Quality
- [x] All TypeScript types are properly defined
- [x] No console.log statements in production code
- [x] All environment variables are documented in .env.example
- [x] Error handling is implemented for all API routes
- [x] Input validation is applied to all endpoints
- [x] Rate limiting is configured for sensitive endpoints

### ‚úÖ Security
- [x] Authentication middleware is applied to protected routes
- [x] JWT secrets are secure and not committed to git
- [x] File upload validation and size limits are enforced
- [x] SQL injection protection via Supabase client
- [x] XSS protection via input sanitization

### üîÑ Database
- [ ] Supabase project is created and configured
- [ ] Database schema is applied from database-schema.sql
- [ ] Row Level Security (RLS) policies are enabled
- [ ] Database indexes are created for performance
- [ ] Backup strategy is configured

### üîÑ Environment Configuration
- [ ] Production Supabase project is set up
- [ ] Environment variables are configured in Vercel
- [ ] JWT_SECRET is generated and secure
- [ ] Storage buckets are created with proper permissions

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Testing
- [ ] API endpoints are tested manually
- [ ] Authentication flow is verified
- [ ] File upload functionality is tested
- [ ] Rate limiting is verified
- [ ] Error scenarios are handled properly

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Supabase Setup
1. Create production Supabase project
2. Run database schema from `database-schema.sql`
3. Enable authentication providers as needed
4. Configure storage buckets
5. Set up Row Level Security policies

### 2. Vercel Deployment
1. Push code to GitHub main branch
2. Import project in Vercel dashboard
3. Configure environment variables:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-prod-supabase-url
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-prod-anon-key
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-prod-service-role-key
   JWT_SECRET=your-secure-jwt-secret
   ```
4. Deploy and test

### 3. Post-Deployment Verification
- [ ] Homepage loads correctly
- [ ] User registration works
- [ ] User login/logout works
- [ ] Protected routes require authentication
- [ ] File uploads work
- [ ] API rate limiting is active
- [ ] Error reporting is configured

## Production Monitoring

### Recommended Tools
- **Error Tracking**: Sentry.io
- **Performance Monitoring**: Vercel Analytics
- **Uptime Monitoring**: Pingdom or UptimeRobot
- **Log Management**: Vercel Functions Logs

### Key Metrics to Monitor
- API response times
- Error rates
- Authentication success/failure rates
- File upload success rates
- Database query performance

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur after deployment:
1. Revert to previous Vercel deployment
2. Check Vercel function logs for errors
3. Verify Supabase service status
4. Review environment variable configuration
5. Test authentication flow manually

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 1 (Immediate)
- [ ] Set up comprehensive error monitoring
- [ ] Add API response caching
- [ ] Implement database connection pooling
- [ ] Add health check endpoints

### Phase 2 (Short-term)
- [ ] Implement automated testing suite
- [ ] Add CI/CD pipeline with tests
- [ ] Set up staging environment
- [ ] Add performance monitoring

### Phase 3 (Long-term)
- [ ] Integrate Solana blockchain features
- [ ] Add real-time features with Supabase
- [ ] Implement advanced caching strategies
- [ ] Add comprehensive audit logging

## Support and Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
- Monitor error rates and performance
- Update dependencies monthly
- Review security vulnerabilities
- Backup database regularly
- Monitor API usage and costs
