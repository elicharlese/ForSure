    This agreement is valid for up to 1 year. Projects can be ended at any time.

    Please review before proceeding:

    For invoice billing projects with hourly submissions, clients will be billed for hours worked. This means that funds are not secured upfront and are instead paid once the freelancer submits hours for work completed. For new relationships, we recommend considering an escrow project instead, where funds are held in escrow and paid out at the end of the project. 

    Switch to an escrow project.
