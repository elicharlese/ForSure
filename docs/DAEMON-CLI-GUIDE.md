Configuration
You can configure the ForSure daemon using a configuration file (
forsure-daemon.config.json
). Place the configuration file in the root directory of your project.

Example Configuration
JSON
Copy
Insert
{
  "pollingInterval": "60000",  // Time in milliseconds to wait between polling for changes
  "logLevel": "info",          // Log level (e.g., "info", "debug", "error")
  "maxMemoryUsage": "512MB"    // Maximum memory usage before restarting the daemon
}
Best Practices
Regular Monitoring: Regularly check the status of the ForSure daemon to ensure it is running smoothly.
Log Management: Monitor and manage logs to avoid excessive disk usage.
Resource Limits: Configure reasonable memory and CPU usage limits to prevent the daemon from affecting other processes.
Troubleshooting
Common Issues
Daemon Fails to Start: Ensure there are no conflicting processes and that the configuration file is correctly formatted.
High Resource Usage: Check and adjust the resource limits in the configuration file.
Command Execution Failures: Ensure the file paths and syntax are correct when using forsure-daemon exec.
