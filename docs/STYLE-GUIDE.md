# Style Guide for ForSure

1. Naming Conventions:

   - **Variables**: Follow camelCase naming convention.
   - **Functions**: Follow camelCase naming convention.
   - **Constants**: Use all uppercase letters with underscores to separate words.
   - **Classes**: Follow PascalCase naming convention.
   - **Files**: Use kebab-case (lowercase letters separated by hyphens) for file names.

2. Formatting Rules:

   - Use consistent indentation with 2 or 4 spaces.
   - Use meaningful whitespace to enhance readability.
   - Limit line length to 80-120 characters to maintain readability.
   - Use comments to explain non-obvious code sections or provide additional context.

3. Code Structure Guidelines:

   - Organize code using a hierarchical structure.
   - Group related files and directories logically.
   - Use objects or dictionaries to represent nested structures with descriptive keys.
   - Provide comments or annotations to explain the purpose of each item or directory.
   - Avoid deeply nested code structures and refactor complex logic into separate functions or modules when appropriate.

4. Documentation Guidelines:
   - Include header comments or annotations at the beginning of each file to summarize its purpose.
   - Use inline comments to explain non-obvious code sections or provide context.
   - Document public APIs, functions, or classes using docstrings or comments to describe their purpose, input parameters, return values, and any side effects.
   - Keep the documentation up to date and in sync with the code changes.

These guidelines can serve as a starting point for the ForSure coding style guide. You can customize and expand upon them based on your team's preferences and the specific requirements of your project.

Remember, consistency is key when establishing coding standards and guidelines. Ensure that all team members are aware of and adhere to the defined conventions to maintain a clean and readable codebase.
