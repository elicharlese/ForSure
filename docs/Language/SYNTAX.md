# ForSure Language Syntax and Semantics

## Introduction

The ForSure language provides a user-friendly and readable syntax for managing and manipulating project structures. This document outlines the core syntax elements and language features of ForSure.

## Syntax Elements

### File System Representation

The ForSure language represents file systems as a collection of folders and files. The syntax for defining file systems is structured using a hierarchical representation.

```
root: {
  // folder and file definitions
}
```

### Folder and File Definitions

The ForSure language allows the definition of folders and files within the file system. These definitions are represented as key-value pairs, where the key is the folder or file name, and the value can be either another folder definition or a list of file names.

```
root: {
  'folder1': {
    'file1.txt',
    'file2.txt'
  },
  'folder2': {
    'subfolder1': {
      'file3.txt'
    },
    'file4.txt'
  }
}
```

### Attributes

Attributes can be attached to file and folder definitions in ForSure. These attributes provide additional metadata such as permissions, size, and types.

```
root: {
  'folder1': {
    'file1.txt': { size: '10KB', type: 'text' },
    'file2.txt': { size: '5KB', type: 'text' }
  }
}
```

### Importing External File Systems

For modular designs, the ForSure language supports importing external file systems using the `@import` directive. This allows for the inclusion of files and folders from other ForSure files.

```
@import 'external.fs';

root: {
  // folder and file definitions
}
```

## Language Features

### Documentation Generation

ForSure provides the ability to automatically generate documentation for file systems in HTML format. This documentation includes a hierarchical representation of folders and files, along with any attached attributes.

### Comments and Annotations

For descriptive purposes and additional information about elements, ForSure allows comments and annotations to be included in the code. These comments and annotations are ignored during the parsing and execution of the language.

## Conclusion

The ForSure language syntax offers a readable and user-friendly way to define and manage project structures. With its support for file system representation, folder and file definitions, attributes, and import capabilities, ForSure provides a powerful tool for enhancing project management.

Please note that this document provides an initial version of the ForSure language syntax and semantics. As the language evolves, additional syntax elements and features may be introduced. Refer to the official ForSure documentation for the latest updates and specifications.
