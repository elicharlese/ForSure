# Core Features

1. Hierarchical Structure: Represents file systems as a collection of folders and files with a clear and concise syntax.
2. Comments and Annotations: Allows inline commenting and metadata association for descriptive purposes.
3. @import Directives: Facilitates file inclusion for reusable structures, enabling modular designs.
4. Custom Attributes: Extends elements with user-defined attributes like permissions, sizes, and types.
5. Readable and Simple Syntax: Prioritizes user understanding and ease of use with a clean and human-readable format.

## Design Goals

1. Usability: Provides a user-friendly and easily interpretable syntax for developers and non-developers to quickly grasp and construct file systems.
2. Extensibility: Offers flexibility and customizability through attributes and the ability to attach metadata to file and folder definitions.
3. Reliability: Implements error handling mechanisms such as customizable error messages, error reporting, and input validation to ensure a robust and stable experience.
4. Tooling & Development Efficiency: Offers code completion, a command-line interface (CLI), APIs for integrations, and editor enhancements like syntax highlighting and linting tools to enhance productivity and improve the development experience.
5. Learning & Community Support: Provides comprehensive documentation, tutorial videos, interactive tutorials, and community support for quick user onboarding and knowledge sharing.

### In terms of programming language paradigms, ForSure incorporates

- Hierarchical Structure Representation: Represents hierarchies using a hierarchical structure similar to a file system.
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Uses a syntax that defines objects (folders and files) and attributes to extend their functionality.
- Functional Programming (FP): Encourages the use of pure functions to manipulate and transform the file system structure.
- Domain-Specific Language (DSL): Defines a specialized language that allows users to express file system structures concisely and clearly.

By including these core features, design goals, and programming language paradigms, ForSure aims to provide a powerful and intuitive tool for managing and documenting file structures in a readable and extensible manner.
