              This Cookies Policy explains how ForSure ("we", "us", or "our")
              uses cookies and similar technologies to recognize you when you
              visit our website and use our services (collectively, the
              "Services"). It explains what these technologies are and why we
              use them, as well as your rights to control our use of them.
            </p>

            <h2>What are cookies?</h2>
            <p>
              Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or
              mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by
              website owners in order to make their websites work, or to work
              more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.
            </p>
            <p>
              Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, ForSure) are
              called "first-party cookies". Cookies set by parties other than
              the website owner are called "third-party cookies". Third-party
              cookies enable third-party features or functionality to be
              provided on or through the website (e.g., advertising, interactive
              content, and analytics). The parties that set these third-party
              cookies can recognize your computer both when it visits the
              website in question and also when it visits certain other
              websites.
            </p>

            <h2>Why do we use cookies?</h2>
            <p>
              We use first-party and third-party cookies for several reasons.
              Some cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our
              Services to operate, and we refer to these as "essential" or
              "strictly necessary" cookies. Other cookies also enable us to
              track and target the interests of our users to enhance the
              experience on our Services. Third parties serve cookies through
              our Services for advertising, analytics, and other purposes.
            </p>

            <h2>Types of cookies we use</h2>
            <p>
              The specific types of first and third-party cookies served through
              our Services and the purposes they perform are described below:
            </p>

            <h3>Essential Cookies</h3>
            <p>
              These cookies are strictly necessary to provide you with services
              available through our Services and to use some of its features,
              such as access to secure areas. Because these cookies are strictly
              necessary to deliver the Services, you cannot refuse them without
              impacting how our Services function.
            </p>

            <h3>Performance and Functionality Cookies</h3>
            <p>
              These cookies are used to enhance the performance and
              functionality of our Services but are non-essential to their use.
              However, without these cookies, certain functionality may become
              unavailable.
            </p>

            <h3>Analytics and Customization Cookies</h3>
            <p>
              These cookies collect information that is used either in aggregate
              form to help us understand how our Services are being used or how
              effective our marketing campaigns are, or to help us customize our
              Services for you.
            </p>

            <h3>Advertising Cookies</h3>
            <p>
              These cookies are used to make advertising messages more relevant
              to you. They perform functions like preventing the same ad from
              continuously reappearing, ensuring that ads are properly
              displayed, and in some cases selecting advertisements that are
              based on your interests.
            </p>

            <h2>How can you control cookies?</h2>
            <p>
              You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies.
              You can exercise your cookie preferences by clicking on the
              appropriate opt-out links provided in the cookie banner on our
              website.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can also set or amend your web browser controls to accept or
              refuse cookies. If you choose to reject cookies, you may still use
              our Services though your access to some functionality and areas of
              our Services may be restricted. As the means by which you can
              refuse cookies through your web browser controls vary from
              browser-to-browser, you should visit your browser's help menu for
              more information.
            </p>

            <h2>How often will we update this Cookie Policy?</h2>
            <p>
              We may update this Cookie Policy from time to time in order to
              reflect, for example, changes to the cookies we use or for other
              operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. Please therefore
              revisit this Cookie Policy regularly to stay informed about our
              use of cookies and related technologies.
